			<h2>Bio</h2>
			<p>
				Rodney Mullen started skateboarding at the age of 10 in 1977. He quickly became obsessed with the sport and would practice for hours every day. At the time, his garage was the only place he could skate, so he developed skills in freestyle skateboarding, which could be performed on flat ground.
				After only a year of owning a skateboard, he began to compete in freestyle competitions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1978, Mullen placed fifth in the Boy's Freestyle category at the US Open Championships at Kona Skatepark in Jacksonville, Florida. His performance earned him a sponsorship through Walker Skateboards, and he proceeded to win many amateur victories throughout the late 1970s. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mullen entered the Oasis Pro competition in 1980, and defeated the world champion, Steve Rocco. He then turned professional as a member of the Bones Brigade team, sponsored by Powell Peralta. By 1990, Rodney Mullen had won thirty-four out of thirty-five freestyle competitions that he had entered, and to this day he has been successful in the skateboarding sport and industry.
