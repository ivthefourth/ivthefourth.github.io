/* *this includes parameters.js from wa_resources

   *make it so each controller can have multiple interface elements (knobs/sliders), 
    and they all get updated together 

   *make this automatable with 'duration' and 'smoothness'( how often to make an automation call to the param and update the interface elements )
    potentially add a temporary transition css which has a length to match 'duration'/'smoothness' or however its actually implemented
