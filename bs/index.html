<h1>Hardstyle Kick Tutorial: Selecting Your Source Sound</h1>
				<p>
					To make a hardstyle kick, you need to start o<span class="test">ff with some kind of source ki</span>ck sound.  You can use a sample, a drum machine, or even just a standard synthesizer.  Below are some important things to keep in mind while selecting or creating the initial sound for your hardstyle kick that you will later distort.  This is very important information, so don’t skip ahead to the “fun part” just yet. </p> 
					<p><strong>
					Note: if you are confused about any terminology on the page, watch the video; everything here is covered in the video with examples.</strong></p>
				
<h2>Kick Samples:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You want it to be a synthesized and tonal drum sample rather than acoustic.  909 kicks are very popular sound sources for making hardstyle kicks.</li>
  <li>You probably want the sample to be high quality and clean.  Any fuzz, background noise, etc., even if subtle, will become <em>very</em> noticeable after you’ve used a few distortion units.  This might result in a sound you like, but it will more likely be undesirable.  Even if you do like that sound, you can always add fuzz to a clean sample using a bit reduction plugin and will have more control over it.</li>
  <li>You need to make sure the kick is long enough.  When played in a 4x4 pattern at your song’s tempo, the tail should overlap the next kick at least slightly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Drumazon:</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.d16.pl/drumazon" target="_blank">Drumazon</a> is a drum machine VST that emulates the sounds of the Roland TR-909.  As mentioned above, 909 kicks are very popular for making hardstyle kicks, and many people use Drumazon to synthesize their own, custom 909 kicks for this purpose.  If you use Drumazon, several of the synthesis techniques explained below will be relevant to you.  You could also try out other drum machine VSTs. </p>
<h2>Synthesizers (recommended):</h2>

<p>I highly recommend using a synthesizer to create your hardstyle kicks.  Using a synth gives you so much more control over your sound, and you won’t have the trouble of determining which pitch your kick plays in; you can even go back after layering effects and adjust your synthesized kick to change the final character quite a bit.  </p><p>A lot of tutorials feature Junglist, Hydra, or Microtonic; but you can make a kick with any synthesizer that offers a volume and pitch envelope, so getting one of these for the sole purpose of creating kicks is rather redundant in my opinion.  I use Sytrus to make my kicks, but you could use Massive, Sylenth 1, etc.  I’ve even used Fruit Kick to make a hardsyle kick but don’t recommend it, because it has no overtones<sup>[1]</sup>. </p>
<h3>How to make a basic kick to be used for a hardstyle kick:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Select a waveform (or layer) that has at least the first and second harmonics [1]; the second harmonic is very important for the character of a hardstyle kick.  If all you have is the fundamental frequency, or even only the odd harmonics (think triangle and square waves), it will be more of a task for you to get the character of the kick to sound much different than a square wave because of how distortion works.  A waveform between a triangle and a saw is what I usually use, but I have gotten great results experimenting with saw, pulse (not pure square), and custom waveforms as well.</li>
  <li>Create a quick, downward pitch envelope.  This fast pitch drop is what creates the kick sound.  You want the pitch to drop quickly enough so that you have a decent length tonal tail but not so quickly that you lose the punch.  I suggest you use a tense, concave pitch envelope which starts steep and levels out, because with your distortion layers, the very slight (we’re talking less than 100 cents) pitch shift of the kick during the tail will add a lot more character compared to a completely static tone.  The height of your pitch envelope (the initial frequency of the pitch drop) helps determine the character of the “tok” or punch sound of your kick.  If you want a deeper sounding “tok,” then you should start at a lower frequency; but if you want a punchier “tok,” you might start at a higher frequency (you aren’t changing the pitch of the whole kick here, only the height of the pitch envelope).  If you plan to make your “tok” completely separate from the kick tail, you don’t need to take this into consideration as much… but do keep in mind how the entire pitch envelope will affect the character of the kick tail.</li>
  <li>Now create a volume envelope.  It’s best to have your kick last slightly longer than the time it takes to reach the next kick at the tempo of your song; if your kick ends too early, it will take some of the power out of your song (if, however, you want your kicks to end early and like the sound of it, go for it).  I usually will have a volume envelope very similar to the pitch envelope, because it helps avoid things sounding too distorted once you start adding your effects.  However, I have made great kicks with many different kinds of volume envelopes, even a couple with fully sustained envelopes.  Don’t worry too much about the curve of the volume envelope at this point, because you can always adjust it later on to get the sound you want.</li>
  <li>Play your kick in the pitch of your song.  There’s really nothing wrong with making your kick in a different key than your song, because you can always pitch it after the fact.  However, creating your kick in key with your song does help you get the character you want.  Kicks will have a slightly different feel at other pitches than they do at the pitch you created them, and what was  a dark kick at G# may not sound so dark at A (even with a perfect pitching algorithm).</li></ol>
