NOTE: if trying to associate parameters, audioparams, or controllers of different

NOTE: Parallel/Double objects should have the same methods as the singular ones
	  and call those mehtods on each of ref and user
	  Parallel/Double objects should only work with other parallel/double or crossfade
NOTE: Use getters and setters when appropriate
